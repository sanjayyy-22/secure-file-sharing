# Secure File Sharing (Learning Project)

This project demonstrates a **BlockShare** built using **React** for the frontend and **Solidity smart contracts** on the blockchain for backend storage and access management.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **File Uploading**: Users can upload files with their IPFS CID stored securely on-chain.
- **Ownership Control**: Each file is associated with an owner who has full control.
- **File Sharing**: Owners can grant access to specific addresses for file verification.
- **File Deletion**: Owners can remove files permanently from the system.
- **File Verification**: Users can check the authenticity, uploader, and timestamp of a file.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Built on Ethereum test network (Sepolia) for learning.
- **React Frontend**: A simple React-based UI to interact with the smart contract.
- **MetaMask Integration**: Connect your MetaMask wallet to interact with the smart contract. Transactions such as upload, share, delete, and verify are signed through MetaMask.

## âš¡ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Solidity (Smart Contract)
- **Storage**: IPFS (for file content), Ethereum (for metadata)

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This project is **created for learning purposes only**.
- Not intended for production use.
